Fatal Issues:
- miter calculation is wrong obviously because they aren't limited (hairrenderer seems to be correct)
    - see https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/11/18/drawing-lines-with-webgl.html
- aa might be wrong as well, but obviously does strange stuff if miter isn't calculated correctly
- possible that per signal yViewRange doesn't seem to work correctly, not showing the correct range, but i think it's actually because of the above errors
- overlapping lines don't look correct, i assume it has to do with opacity


Mermory Efficiency:
- implement multiple buffers / spread the vertexes across mutliple buffers as a single buffer has a size limit
- vertices could be further recuced by using point/normal instead of prev/current/next
    - the trasform will have to be adjusted to keep the normal orthogonal after transformation
    - not sure if this actually works with the meter but i assume you can alos adjust the transform to keep angles
- encode colors as byte^3 instead of float^4
