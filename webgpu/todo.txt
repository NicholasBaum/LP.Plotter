- implement multiple buffers / spread the vertexes across mutliple buffers as a single buffer has a size limit

Mermory Efficiency:
- vertices could be further recuced by using point/normal instead of prev/current/next
    - the trasform will have to be adjusted to keep the normal orthogonal after transformation
    - not sure if this actually works with the meter but i assume you can alos adjust the transform to keep angles
- encode colors as byte^3 instead of float^4
